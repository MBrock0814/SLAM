# SLAM

 To update the site all you have to do is edit the markdown file that are in the docs folder in the SLAM project on github. To edit the markdown files you can use a markdown editor and just save the document and upload it over the old document. To make minor edits you can edit then directly in the github files. Pictures are located in the images folder, PDF are located in the PDF-Section folder. If you want to add more pages to the site all you have to do is add this, 
 ---
layout: default
title: Home
permalink:
---
 to a markdown file and chage the title to the name of the new page and the peralink to /*page name*/, add information to the page and then once it is upload to the docs folder in github it should automatically reload and add your new site.
