# Budget and Cost
This project requires many components in order to be successful. The client has provided us with Thumper, Pixhawk Autopilot, and 3DR UBlox GPS + Compass Module so they will not be included in our budget analysis. The resources required have been divided into two categories: Financial and Guidance. Without either resource, this project would not be able to be completed. 

**8.1 Financial**

Table 5 shows the cost of the parts for the ZED and Jetson TX1 system, as well as the total cost of the system. Table 6 shows the cost of the materials needed to build the mount and the total cost of the mount.

**8.2 Guidance**

Each team member chose one to two advisors as a guide for their respective area of the project. The chosen technical advisors provided great insight and guidance in terms of their specialization. Their contributions are invaluable to this project.
