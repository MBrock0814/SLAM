# Final Design Specifications
The final design specifications are divided into two categories, system requirements and mount design.
 
 **7.1 System Requirements** 

For the ZED and Jetson TX1 system to function properly, all the following hardware and software requirements must be met. 
 
Requirements for ZED Stereo Camera and ZED SDK:

* Dual-core 2.3GHz processor or faster 
* 4 GB of RAM
* NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capabilities > 2.0 
* CUDA 8.0 
* USB 3.0 port with latest drivers
* Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 (64bits), Ubuntu 14.04 

 **7.2 Mount**
 
The chosen mount design, Design 2 which can be seen in Figure 11, will be constructed from PVC with an arm length of 5” and a platform width of 7”. The ZED Stereo Camera will be secured to the platform by using a nylon strap. Constructing the mount out of PVC will keep the cost low, $115, while still meeting all feasibility criteria.
